## Control Flow projects
* 0-positive_or_negative.py: prints whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.
* 1-last_digit.py: print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.
* 2-print_alphabet.py: prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
* 3-print_alphabt.py: prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line, Print all the letters except q and e.
* 4-print_hexa.py: prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example).
* 5-print_comb2.py: prints numbers from 0 to 99.
* 6-print_comb3.py: prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
* 7-islower.py: checks for lowercase character.
* 8-uppercase.py: a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
* 9-print_last_digit.py: prints the last digit of a number.
* 10-add.py: a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
* 11-pow.py: a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
* 12-fizzbuzz.py: a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. 
	* For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz.
	* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
* 13-insert_number.c: a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
* 100-print_tebahpla.py: prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.
* 101-remove_char_at.py: creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the "C array index").
* 102-magic_calculation.py: Python function that does exactly the same as a Python bytecode
